# bookingClient
Thing that lets you book tickets (but not really)

This, this right here, is the good stuff.
Get your inputs, save all your personal data, remove all your personal data and all of that with the simple click of quite a lot of buttons on your keyboard and the brutal and abrupt removal and resurrection of temporary files.
Booking fake tickets and having them not really sent to you through a non-existent mail server or whatever you'd need for that kinda functionality has never been this exciting.

Simply execute go.main by typing ``go run go.main`` into your highly terminalized terminal and slap a(n) `` order``, `` reset`` or `` list`` behind that badboy and you're already swimming with he sharks or something.
